        Coffee Break is pleased to be the first coffee shop in South Boston to serve "Stumptown Coffee" and "Indian Coffee" products exclusively. Stumptown, originating in Portland Oregon had been named "Best Coffee in the World" by NPR, The New York Times, Food & Wine Magazine, and USA Today. To ensure exceptional quality and freshness we obtain our beans directly from Stumptown's roasting facility in Brooklyn, New York and Karnataka,India.
